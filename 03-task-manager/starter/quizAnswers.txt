1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

Middleware is a function that have an access to request object, the response 
object and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
Middleware in Express can be defined globally using app.use() - middleware will be applied to all routes 
OR we can apply to a specific route by passing it as an argument to the route handle like so: app.post('login', authentication, (req, res){
    // block of code
})
where authentication is as a middleware function that applied only for login route.

2. What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.
This is a common approach that allows users or apps to perform operations on data. 

You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
- By installing ```dotenv``` package and use its ```config()``` method to load the environment variables like so: 
require('dotenv').config(). Then we getting access to a assigned variable from ```.env``` file
using ```process.env``` object. 
For example: 
inside the .env file: SECRET_KEY = 1234
in the file that we want to use our SECRET_KEY: require('dotenv').config()
const SECRET_KEY = process.env.SECRET_KEY; 

How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
- In order to avoid exposing a sensitive information before pushing into GitHub we add files that we want to ignore into .gitignore file. 
You also can notice as soon as you add it, our file's icon or folder become faded out in our code editor.
